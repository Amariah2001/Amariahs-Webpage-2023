        <p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is Amariah Robinson and I am a student here at Central Piedmont.
        I have been here for a couple of years now due to me taking a gap year in between semesters.
        I am from Fayetteville, NC and moved to Charlotte, NC when I was around 5 years old and have been here ever since!
        I recently had a dog, pictured above, whose name is Autumn and she was almost a 12 year old Husky German Shepherd mix.
        Anyone who knows about dogs knows how stubborn and loud Huskies and German Shepherds can be, but surprisingly, she was quiet.
